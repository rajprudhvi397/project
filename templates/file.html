<h1 id="fam">Birth,Family and Education</h1>
<p>MS Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devki Devi. His paternal village is in the Lamgara block in Almora, Uttarakhand. His father, Pan Singh, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi and worked in junior management positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister and a brother-- Jayanti Gupta (sister) and Narendra Singh Dhoni (Brother).
</p>
<p>
Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Ranchi, Jharkhand and excelled in multiple sports such as badminton, football and cricket. He played as a goalkeeper for his football team and played cricket for a local club.
</p>
<p>
Dhoni showed impressive wicket-keeping skills at the Commando Cricket Club during 1995-98 and was picked up for Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship for the 1997-98 session and played well. After completing High School, Dhoni focussed on Cricket.
  </p>

<p>In the year 1998, MS Dhoni was selected for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till 1998, he played for the school cricket team and club cricket. Whenever Dhoni hit a six in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket matches, he was gifted Rs 50 by Deval Sahay, who selected him for CCL. With the help of his excellent performance, CCL moved to A division. Deval Sahay was impressed with his dedication and cricket skills and pushed for his selection in the Bihar team. For the 1999-2000 season, he got selected in the senior Bihar Ranji Team at the age of 18. He was not selected for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or the Rest of the India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy).</p>
 <img src="{% static 'image/img3.jpg' %}" >
    <p>Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa and England. In June 2007, Dhoni received an A Grade contract from the BCCI. In September 2007, for the World Twenty20 matches, Dhoni was elected as the captain of the Indian team. In September 2007, Dhoni shared a record with his idol Adam Gilchrist-- most dismissals in an innings in ODI.</p>

  <p>  In 2009, during the series between India and Australia, Dhoni scored 124 runs off 107 balls in the second ODI and 71 runs off 95 balls in the third ODI. On September 30, 2009, Dhoni took his first wicket in international cricket against West Indies in the Champions Trophy. In 2009, he topped the ICC ODI Batsman ranking.</p>

   <p> In January 2017, Dhoni stepped down as the captain of the Indian team in all the limited-over formats. In the ODI home series against England, he scored well and was named as a wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy and ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.</p>

  <p>In August 2017, during the ODI against Sri Lanka, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings.

  <p>In the 2019 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni was selected for the Indian team. Dhoni played well against South Africa, Australia and West Indies but was criticised for his strike rate against Afghanistan and England. In the semi-finals against New Zealand, Dhoni scored a half-century in the second innings but was run out at a very crucial stage. With his dismissal, India's World Cup run ended.</p>

 <p> In 2018, the ban on Chennai Super Kings was uplifted and the team returned to play the IPL. Dhoni was again contracted by CSK and led the team to win the third IPL title. In 2019, he again captained for CSK and the team emerged to be one of the strongest in the season. However, Mumbai Indians won the title.

<h1 id="ps">MS.DHONI: Playing Style</h1>
<p>MS Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He is famously known for his lower-order attacking mode which he later changed due to his responsibility as a captain. He is also one of the fastest running men between the wickets. His Helicopter Shot technique is loved by all which was taught to him by his fellow player childhood friend Santosh Lal.</p>
  <p>Apart from batting, he is widely appreciated for his wicket-keeping skills by several experts of the game. He is the quickest wicket-keeper when it comes to stumpings. He holds a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper. He sometimes bowls as a medium-fast bowler for the Indian Cricket team.</p>
